NTP Client
Description
This project implements a simple NTP (Network Time Protocol) client in Python. The client queries an NTP server to synchronize its time with the server's time. This can be useful for applications that require accurate and synchronized time information.

Features
Queries an NTP server to get the current time
Parses the NTP response to calculate the current time
Handles socket communication with the NTP server
Displays the current time obtained from the NTP server
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ntp-client.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ntp-client
Run the NTP client:
Copy code
python ntp_client.py
The client will output the current time obtained from the NTP server.
Configuration
By default, the client queries the pool.ntp.org NTP server. You can change the server address in the get_ntp_time function in the ntp_client.py file.
The client uses UDP port 123 to communicate with the NTP server. Ensure that your firewall allows outbound UDP traffic on this port.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
